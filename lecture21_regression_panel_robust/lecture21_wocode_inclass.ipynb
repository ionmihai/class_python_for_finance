The Z instrument is then used to extract the exogenous variation in X, which in turn is used in our main regression instead of X.\n",

If high-quality managers, say, also like to hold a lot of cash, then the cash holdings variable in endogenous (in the equation above, cash holdings is part of X and management quality would be part of $\\epsilon$ since it affects ROA but is not part of our explanatory variables X). However, if management quality is relatively constant over time, we can control for its effects on ROA by demeaning the data at the firm level. This is what a firm fixed effects estimator does. \n",
