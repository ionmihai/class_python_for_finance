We will then perform a regression analysis where firm future profitability is the dependent variable, and firm cash holdings, book leverage,and investment are the explanatory variables. In this lecture, we will showcase some common practical issues that one needs to be aware of any time they run a regression:\n",
    "1. The effect of outliers on our regression results\n",
    "2. The difference between economic magnitude and statistical significance\n",
    "3. Multicollinearity (highly correlated independent variables)\n",

    "In the following lecture, we will continue this analysis by tackling two other very common issues with regression analysis:\n",
    "1. The potential presence of \"fixed-effects\" in the data\n",
